# Who

My name's VÃ­ctor Peinado and I'm an NLP practioner.

Please notice here NLP stands for *Natural Language Processing*, a subfield of
Artificial Intelligence devote to make machines understand natural language.

# What

I'm a language geek. I always dreamed of talking machines.

I currently work as a Senior NLP/ML Engineer at [Reply.ai](https://www.reply.ai). I also enjoy [teaching stuff about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing](https://kschool.com/profesor/victor-peinado/).

I used to work at [Minsait/INDRA](https://www.minsait.com), helping apply NLP and ML to AI products for different domains. And before that, I helped develop [Google's Natural Language products](https://www.wired.com/2016/11/googles-search-engine-can-now-answer-questions-human-help/), [teached Computacional Linguistics courses at UCM](https://www.ucm.es/), and did [some research on NLP and Multilingual Information Access at UNED's NLP&IR Group](http://nlp.uned.es/~victor/).

In the free time, I love running, riding my bike, playing the guitar...
